## 📌 What Makes a Good Resource?

We’re looking for content that is:

- ✅ **High quality** – Clear, well-written, technically accurate
- ✅ **Helpful** – Explains concepts, solves real problems, or deepens understanding
- ✅ **Evergreen** – Not overly time-sensitive unless still relevant
- ✅ **Free and accessible** – Publicly available without paywalls whenever possible

Prefer original content over duplicated tutorials or reposts.
